**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.


### Loading Data
The code for loading the image data to train the classifier is present in classifier.py.

### Hog Parameters
Below are the final HOG parameters that I have chosen which gave the best accuracy.

| Parameter      | Value     |
|----------------|-----------|
| Color Space    | YCrCb     |
| Spatial Size   | 32 X 32   |
| Histogram Bins | 32        |
| Hog Pixels     | 8         |
| Hog Cells      | 2         |
| Hog Channel    | ALL       |

### Classifier
I have used LinearSVC as classifier for the project. The training process is part of [classifier.py](https://github.com/VenkatRepaka/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/vehicle_detection/classifier.py)
The classifier data is stored in classifier.p using pickle.

Below are the predictions of classifier on test images with ystart 400, ystop 650 and scale 1.5

### Image pipeline

The ranges I have chosen for different scales
~~~
ystart = 360
ystop = 560
scale = 1.5

ystart = 400
ystop = 500
scale = 1

ystart = 400
ystop = 600
scale = 1.8

ystart = 350
ystop = 700
scale = 2.5

ystart = 350
ystop = 700
scale = 3

#### Discussion
Many of the bounding boxes are not completely enclosing the cars in the video. Changing the thresholding will help but this is increasing the false positives.

The speed of the process involved here is extremely slow.
